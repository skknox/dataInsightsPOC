to RCW 39.04.155, RCW 39.04.280, federally funded competitive solicitations where
such agencies prohibit the application of bid preferences, or any other procurement
exempt from competitive bidding.
Bidders must provide the City of Tacoma with their state of incorporation or the state in
which the business entity was formed and include whether the bidder has a physical
office located in Washington.
The bidder shall submit documentation demonstrating compliance with above criteria on

of actions taken pursuant to such procedure.

entire occupancy of the premises by the City, shall constitute an acceptance of work not done in
accordance with the Contract Documents or relieve the Contractor of liability in respect to any
express warranties or responsibility for faulty materials or workmanship. The Contractor shall
remedy any defects in the work and pay for any damage to other work resulting therefrom, which
shall appear within a period of one year from the date of final acceptance of the work unless a
longer period is specified. The City will give notice of observed defects with reasonable
promptness.
If it has been discovered, before payment is required under the terms of the Contract, that there is
a failure to comply with any of the terms and provisions of this Contract, the City has the right and
may withhold payment.

date of receipt by the City. All of the costs (including shipping, dismantling and reinstallation) of
repairs and/or corrections of defective or failed equipment, supplies and/or material is the

payments until a Progress Schedule has been submitted which meets the requirements of this
section.

corrective action plan or revise the Progress Schedule to reconcile with the actual progress of the
Work.

E.

E.

Contract Time adjustment only for concurrent fault: To the extent any delay or failure of
performance was concurrently caused by the Owner and Contractor, Contractor shall be entitled

Subcontractor or Contractor, as the case may be, of all relevant information concerning the
dispute.

3.07

DAMAGES FOR FAILURE TO ACHIEVE TIMELY COMPLETION

A.

Liquidated Damages

B.

1.

Reason for Liquidated Damages: Timely performance and completion of the Work is
essential to Owner and time limits stated in the Contract Documents are of the essence.
Owner will incur serious and substantial damages if Substantial Completion of the Work
does not occur within the Contract Time. However, it would be difficult if not impossible
to determine the exact amount of such damages. Consequently, provisions for liquidated
damages are included in the Contract Documents.

2.

Calculation of Liquidated Damages amount: The liquidated damage amounts set forth in
the Contract Documents will be assessed not as a penalty, but as liquidated damages for
breach of the Contract Documents. This amount is fixed and agreed upon by and
between the Contractor and Owner because of the impracticability and extreme difficulty
of fixing and ascertaining the actual damages the Owner would in such event sustain.
This amount shall be construed as the actual amount of damages sustained by the
Owner, and may be retained by the Owner and deducted from periodic payments to the
Contractor.

3.

Contractor responsible even if Liquidated Damages assessed: Assessment of liquidated
damages shall not release Contractor from any further obligations or liabilities pursuant to
the Contract Documents.

Actual Damages
Calculation of Actual Damages: Actual damages will be assessed for failure to achieve Final
Completion within the time provided. Actual damages will be calculated on the basis of direct
architectural, administrative, and other related costs attributable to the Project from the date when
Final Completion should have been achieved, based on the date Substantial Completion is
actually achieved, to the date Final Completion is actually achieved. Owner may offset these
costs against any payment due Contractor.

Contract Documents.

D.

Contractor responsibilities on inspections: Contractor shall promptly furnish, without additional
charge, all facilities, labor, material and equipment reasonably needed for performing such safe
and convenient inspections and tests as may be required by Owner. Owner may charge
Contractor any additional cost of inspection or testing when Work is not ready at the time

retest necessary. Owner shall perform its inspections and tests in a manner that will cause no
undue delay in the Work.

5.16

CORRECTION OF NONCONFORMING WORK

A.

Work covered by Contractor without inspection: If a portion of the Work is covered contrary to the

Contract Time.

B.

Payment provisions for uncovering covered Work: If, at any time prior to Final Completion,
Owner desires to examine the Work, or any portion of it, which has been covered, Owner may
request to see such Work and it shall be uncovered by Contractor. If such Work is in accordance
with the Contract Documents, the Contractor shall be entitled to an adjustment in the Contract
Sum for the costs of uncovering and replacement, and, if completion of the Work is thereby
delayed, an adjustment in the Contract Time, provided it makes such a request as provided in

completed. Contractor shall bear all costs of correcting such nonconforming Work, including
additional testing and inspections.

Completion of the Work or designated portion thereof, or within one year after the date for
commencement of any system warranties established under Section 6.08, or within the terms of
any applicable special warranty required by the Contract Documents, any of the Work is found to
be not in accordance with the requirements of the Contract Documents, Contractor shall correct it
promptly after receipt of written notice from Owner to do so. Owner shall give such notice
promptly after discovery of the condition. This period of one year shall be extended, with respect
to portions of Work first performed after Substantial Completion, by the period of time between
Substantial Completion and the actual performance of the Work. Contractorâs duty to correct with
respect to Work repaired or replaced shall run for one year from the date of repair or
replacement. Obligations under this paragraph shall survive Final Acceptance.

construed to establish a period of limitation with respect to other obligations which Contractor
might have according to the Contract Documents. Establishment of the time period of one year
as described in Section 5.16D relates only to the specific obligation of Contractor to correct the
Work, and has no relationship to the time within which the Contractorâs obligation to comply with
the Contract Documents may be sought to be enforced, including the time within which such
proceedings may be commenced.

I.

Owner may accept non-conforming Work and charge Contractor: If Owner prefers to accept
Work which is not in accordance with the requirements of the Contract Documents, Owner may
do so instead of requiring its removal and correction, in which case the Contract Sum may be
reduced as appropriate and equitable.

CHANGE IN THE CONTRACT SUM

A.

General Application
1.

Contract Sum changes only by Change Order: The Contract Sum shall only be changed
by a Change Order. Contractor shall include any request for a change in the Contract
Sum in its Change Order Proposal.

2.

Owner fault or negligence as basis for change in Contract Sum: If the cost of
Contractorâs performance is changed due to the fault or negligence of Owner, or anyone
for whose acts Owner is responsible, Contractor shall be entitled to make a request for
an equitable adjustment in the Contract Sum in accordance with the following procedure.
No change in the Contract Sum shall be allowed to the extent: Contractorâs changed cost
of performance is due to the fault or negligence of Contractor, or anyone for whose acts
Contractor is responsible; the change is concurrently caused by Contractor and Owner;
or the change is caused by an act of Force Majeure as defined in Section 3.05.
(a) Notice and record keeping for equitable adjustment: A request for an equitable
adjustment in the Contract Sum shall be based on written notice delivered to Owner
within 7 Days of the occurrence of the event giving rise to the request. For purposes
of this part, âoccurrenceâ means when Contractor knew, or in its diligent prosecution
of the Work should have known, of the event giving rise to the request. If Contractor
believes it is entitled to an adjustment in the Contract Sum, Contractor shall
immediately notify Owner and begin to keep and maintain complete, accurate, and
specific daily records. Contractor shall give Owner access to any such records and,
if requested shall promptly furnish copies of such records to Owner.
(b) Content of notice for equitable adjustment; Failure to comply: Contractor shall not
be entitled to any adjustment in the Contract Sum for any occurrence of events or
costs that occurred more than 7 Days before Contractorâs written notice to Owner.
The written notice shall set forth, at a minimum, a description of: the event giving
rise to the request for an equitable adjustment in the Contract Sum; the nature of the
impacts to Contractor and its Subcontractors of any tier, if any; and to the extent
possible the amount of the adjustment in Contract Sum requested. Failure to
properly give such written notice shall, to the extent Ownerâs interests are
prejudiced, constitute a waiver of Contractorâs right to an equitable adjustment.
(c) Contractor to provide supplemental information: Within 30 Days of the occurrence
of the event giving rise to the request, unless Owner agrees in writing to allow an
additional period of time to ascertain more accurate data, Contractor shall
supplement the written notice provided in accordance with subparagraph a. above
with additional supporting data. Such additional data shall include, at a minimum:
the amount of compensation requested, itemized in accordance with the procedure
set forth herein; specific facts, circumstances, and analysis that confirms not only
that Contractor suffered the damages claimed, but that the damages claimed were
actually a result of the act, event, or condition complained of and that the Contract
Documents provide entitlement to an equitable adjustment to Contractor for such
act, event, or condition; and documentation sufficiently detailed to permit an
informed analysis of the request by Owner. When the request for compensation
relates to a delay, or other change in Contract Time, Contractor shall demonstrate
the impact on the critical path, in accordance with Section 7.03C. Failure to provide
such additional information and documentation within the time allowed or within the
format required shall, to the extent Ownerâs interests are prejudiced, constitute a
waiver of Contractorâs right to an equitable adjustment.

day beyond the number of days established for final completion, and
2. To authorize the City to deduct these liquidated damages from any money due or
coming due to the Contractor.

replacement of temporary substitute facilities, or correction or repair remains to physically
complete the total contract, the City may determine the work is substantially complete. The
City will notify the Contractor in writing of the substantial completion date. For overruns in
contract time occurring after the date so established, the formula for liquidated damages as
shown above will not apply. For overruns in contract time occurring after the substantial
completion date, liquidated damages shall be assessed on the basis of direct engineering
and related costs assignable to the project until actual final completion date of all the contract
work. The Contractor shall complete the remaining work as promptly as possible.

calendar days maintaining the original contract completion requirement. The lost work time,
however, shall not relieve the Contractor from any Contract responsibility.
D. If the work is suspended for reason (2) above, the period of work stoppage will be counted as
working days. The lost work time, however, shall not relieve the Contractor from any contract
responsibility.
E. If the performance of all or any part of the work is suspended, delayed, or interrupted for an
unreasonable period of time by an act of the Contracting Agency in the administration of the
Contract, or by failure to act within the time specified in the Contract (or if no time is
specified), the City will make an adjustment for any increase in the cost or time for the
performance of the Contract (excluding profit, overhead, home office expense, supervisory
personnel labor not specifically assigned to the project) necessarily caused by the
suspension, delay, or interruption. However, no adjustment will be made for any suspension,
delay, or interruption if (1) the performance would have been suspended, delayed or
interrupted by any other cause, including the fault or negligence of the Contractor, or (2) an
equitable adjustment is provided for or excluded under any other provision of the Contract.
F. If the Contractor believes that the performance of the work is suspended, delayed, or
interrupted for an unreasonable period of time and such suspension, delay, or interruption is
the responsibility of the Contracting Agency, the Contractor shall immediately submit a written
request for equitable adjustment to the Engineer as provided in Section 7.02. No adjustment
shall be allowed for any costs incurred more than 2 calendar days before the date the
Engineer receives the Contractorâs written request for equitable adjustment. If the Contractor
contends damages have been suffered as a result of such suspension, delay, or interruption,
the protest shall not be allowed unless the request for equitable adjustment (stating the
amount of damages) is asserted in writing within 14 calendar days of end of the delay. The
Contractor shall keep full and complete records of the costs and additional time of such
suspension, delay, or interruption and shall permit the Engineer to have access to those
records and any other records as may be deemed necessary by the Engineer to assist in
evaluating the protest.

SC-12

increase in cost necessarily caused by the suspension, delay, or interruption.
H. Request for extensions of time will be evaluated in accordance with Section 7.03.

Washington State Department of Labor and Industries
Policy Statement
(Regarding the Production of "Standard" or "Non-standard" Items)
Below is the department's (State L&amp;I's) list of criteria to be used in determining whether a
prefabricated item is "standard" or "non-standard". For items not appearing on
WSDOT's predetermined list, these criteria shall be used by the Contractor (and the
Contractor's subcontractors, agents to subcontractors, suppliers, manufacturers, and
fabricators) to determine coverage under RCW 39.12. The production, in the State of
Washington, of non-standard items is covered by RCW 39.12, and the production of
standard items is not. The production of any item outside the State of Washington is not
covered by RCW 39.12.
1. Is the item fabricated for a public works project? If not, it is not subject to RCW
39.12. If it is, go to question 2.
2. Is the item fabricated on the public works jobsite? If it is, the work is covered under
RCW 39.12. If not, go to question 3.
3. Is the item fabricated in an assembly/fabrication plant set up for, and dedicated
primarily to, the public works project? If it is, the work is covered by RCW 39.12. If not,
go to question 4.
4. Does the item require any assembly, cutting, modification or other fabrication by the
supplier? If not, the work is not covered by RCW 39.12. If yes, go to question 5.
5. Is the prefabricated item intended for the public works project typically an inventory
item which could reasonably be sold on the general market? If not, the work is covered
by RCW 39.12. If yes, go to question 6.
6. Does the specific prefabricated item, generally defined as standard, have any
unusual characteristics such as shape, type of material, strength requirements, finish,
etc? If yes, the work is covered under RCW 39.12.
Any firm with questions regarding the policy, WSDOT's Predetermined List, or for
determinations of covered and non-covered workers shall be directed to State L&amp;I at
(360) 902-5330.
